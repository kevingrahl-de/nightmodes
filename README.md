# nightmodes
Nightmode for every website

Personally I'm a big fan of UI's that use a dark background with light text on top.
For many sites I use I extended the original CSS to include a permanent night mode.

In this repository I'll collect and share those css snippets so that anyone may use them.

- You're welcome to request websites by opening an issue.
- You may also contribute to this repository by adding snippets for websites as long as they follow the same color scheme and have a comparable license.
